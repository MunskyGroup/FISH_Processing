## Description

This repository contains the codes used to quantify FISH images for the publication Ron et al. 2024. All microscope images are stored in the NAS (munsky-nas).  

## Folder overview

* [Image_Processing]: This folder contains two BASH scripts used to process all FISH images. 
  * image_processing_script_DUSP1.sh
  *  image_processing_script_GR.sh
  
* [Data_interpretation]: This folder contains ```Notebok_Data_Interpretation.ipynb```. This notebooks summarizes the complete dataframes for the GR and DUSP1 experiments. The code returns a summarized dataframe for all experimental conditions with the fields:
  *  Cell_id
  *  Condition 
  *  Replica 
  *  Dex_Conc 
  *  Time_index 
  *  Time_TPL 
  *  Nuc_Area 
  *  Cyto_Area 
  *  Nuc_GR_avg_int 
  *  Cyto_GR_avg_int
  *  Nuc_DUSP1_avg_int 
  *  Cyto_DUSP1_avg_int 
  *  RNA_DUSP1_nuc 
  *  RNA_DUSP1_cyto 

## Getting Started

To get started with these codes, clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure that you have the necessary software installed, including Bash and Jupyter Notebook.
